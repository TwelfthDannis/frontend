# My Portfolio website 

<h1>Welcome to my portfolio website!</h1>
<span style="font-size: 16px">Here you will find my certificates and projects that I have successfully completed or worked on. I have done a lot of work on each project and use this site to share my achievements.
In the certificates section you can see all my professional certificates and diplomas that confirm my skills and competencies in certain areas. I am sure that these certificates confirm my ability to perform tasks at the highest level.
The projects section contains descriptions and results of my successfully completed projects. Here you can get acquainted with the tasks I have encountered and find out what tools and technologies I have used to implement them. Screenshots or links to an online demo are attached to each project so that you can better understand what exactly I did.
I am constantly improving my knowledge and skills, so this site will be constantly updated with new projects and certificates. If you have any questions or are interested in cooperation, do not hesitate to contact me through the contact information provided on the website.
Thank you for visiting my portfolio site and I hope you enjoy viewing my works!</span><hr>
